        <p>
          User agrees to abide by all policies, directives, payment agreements,
          and credit card agreements involved in this transaction. User
          understands that payment is due at the time services are rendered. The

          considered past due and are subject to an interest rate of not greater
          than eighteen percent per annum (18%). Interest shall be calculated

        <p>POSTAL AUTOMATION DISCOUNTS:</p>

        <p>
          In certain cases, User may elect to have their postage pre-sorted
          through the COS pre-sort system. Such pre-sort shall entitle the user
          to a postal discount of three cents for first class postage under 1 oz
          where the pre-sort material is a number 10 envelope. No postal
          discounts are provided for mailings which must be sent in flats or 6x9
          envelopes. Users who elect the postal pre-sort discount option direct
          COS to utilize the USPS Move Update database, effective as of January
          2013, to verify the postal address provided and update or reject the
          address accordingly. User understands that COS compliance with the
          USPS guidelines is mandatory to receive postal automation discounts.
          User agrees that upon receipt of any returned mail, they will update
          the ECF Master Mailing Matrix with the appropriate address. In order
          to begin receiving postal discounts, the User must complete the Postal
          Processing Acknowledgement Form (PAF) and agree to the terms therein.

        </p>

        <p>COPYING FEES:</p>

        <p>
          Copy charges are based upon the number of pages submitted in the user
          file at the present rate of fifteen cents per page. Rates are subject
          to change without notice. A 5 page document will incur a $.75 charge
          for one reproduction. Multiply the number of pages against the number
          of addresses on the master mailing matrix to determine your
          approximate final costs. For example, a 5 page document x 75 addresses
          will result in a charge of $56.25. There is a minimum $5.00 charge
          plus postage per job submission. Postage is billed at the present rate
          of the United States Postal System for first class mail, weight and

        <p>
          Job cut-off times are noon PST, 1p.m. MST, 2p.m. CST, and 3 p.m. EST.
          Jobs which are submitted after the deadline will be slated for
          delivery the next day. Certain Users may elect, through the webform,
          to upload jobs after the cutoff time, but before 4 p.m. PST, and
          direct that they be slated for mailing that same day. Any such user
          who elects to have their job mailed as a rush-priority job will be
          billed at the rush priority rate of twenty five cents per page. For
          example, a 5 page document, slated for mailing at the rush-priority
          rate will a incur a $1.25 charge for one reproduction. Multiple the
          number of pages against the number of addresses on the master mailnig
          matrix to determine your approximate final costs. Jobs submitted under
          the Rush Priority Rule will receive no postal discounts and will be
          billed for postage at the normal first class mailing rates.
        </p>

        <p>MO MODIFICATIONS:</p>

        <p>
